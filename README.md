# Simulation code for ACM CS&Law 2025 paper

This repository contains the simulation code for Section 6 of our paper "Regulation of Algorithmic Collusion, Refined: Testing Pessimistic Calibrated Regret" appearing at ACM CS&Law 2025. The simulation is designed to test the effect of unknown costs of the auditing method.

## Running the simulation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
./run.sh
```

To modify the configuration, edit `config.py` as needed.
